#My A-Frame.js Galaxy

This is a simple virtual reality project made using [A-Frame.js](http://aframe.io).  It's really just a couple circles and a ring around one of them.  It was a very quick and fun build, the project taking only about an hour (including time spent reading up on the A-Frame syntax).
